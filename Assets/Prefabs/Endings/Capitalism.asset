  description: "In 2004, Ukraine\u2019s election of a Jewish president symbolized
    openness and capitalism\u2019s rising influence. In 2009, the global economy
    transformed, with bytecoin replacing traditional money. By 2014, money controlled
    everything, even basic survival. Breathing became a privilege, costing 10 bytecoins
    per breath. Those unable to pay simply ceased to exist. Capitalism reached its
    peak, where life was measured not in time but in bytecoin balances."
