  description: "The rise of the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s influence was coupled
    with a decline in the value of human labor due to automation and the availability
    of cheap labor. The system was reinforced by ideology: taking an oath to the
    Party became the only path to survival. Despite total control, no meme or criticism
    of the Party was removed, as the online environment became fully monitored and
    regulated. Humanity gradually adapted to the new rules of the game, choosing
    survival over freedom."
