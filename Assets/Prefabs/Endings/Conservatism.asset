  description: "In 2004, George Boker Vush\u2019s election strengthened conservatism\u2019s
    grip. By 2008, the Republican Party abolished the Democratic Party, establishing
    a one-party system in the name of \"national stability.\" In 2010, a massive
    glass dome was built over the United States, completely controlling entry and
    exit. Citizens lived in relative peace, but the cost was high: every aspect of
    life was controlled, and dissent was punished severely."
