  description: "In 2004, a new leader in North Korea consolidated power and expanded
    influence beyond the nation. Using total surveillance ideology, a system emerged
    where every citizen was constantly monitored. By 2007, the concept of \"Big Brother\"
    dominated half the globe. Cameras, sensors, and algorithms controlled every action
    and word. Freedom became a myth, and people\u2019s lives were entirely subject
    to the state\u2019s will."
