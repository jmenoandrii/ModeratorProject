  description: "In 2004, the assassination of the British king by a Chinese agent
    ignited global conflict. By 2006, World War III was in full swing, involving
    all major powers. Technological warfare reached its peak, leaving no room for
    peace. By 2012, Earth was a barren wasteland, with only remnants of civilization
    surviving. Militarism became the ultimate symbol of humanity\u2019s self-destruction."
