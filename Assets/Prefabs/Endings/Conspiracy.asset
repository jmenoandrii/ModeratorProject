  description: In 2012, the Mayan calendar came true. The strange phenomena that
    began in 2004 reached a climax. The sky was lit up with unearthly lights, the
    planet Nibiru approached, and time stood still. Humanity disappeared without
    a trace, leaving empty cities and unsolved mysteries. The end of the world came
    quietly, like the completion of a great cycle, and the Earth turned into a silent
    artefact in the vast cosmos.
