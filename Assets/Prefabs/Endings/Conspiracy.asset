  description: In 2012, the Mayan calendar prophecy came true. Strange phenomena,
    which had started in 2004, reached their peak in 2012. The skies lit up with
    unearthly lights, Planet Nibiru drew closer, and its gravitational field tore
    the Earth apart. Humanity vanished almost instanlty. The end of the world came
    quietly, like the conclusion of a great cycle, turning Earth into a silent artifact
    in the vast cosmos.
