  description: "In 2004, the world achieved unprecedented peace. By 2007, nearly
    all weapons were destroyed, and humanity embraced pacifism. But in 2012, an alien
    invasion occurred. With no way to resist, humans were quickly defeated and imprisoned
    in cocoons, serving as energy sources for their new overlords. Humanity\u2019s
    pursuit of peace became its ultimate downfall."
